## Forewords

In the summer of 2011, Google launched its social service -- Google Plus (G+).
I don't want to comment on this move and what happened during the two years. 
You already see the current status.
Now I want to review one incident at the launch time. 
I belive there were more victims because I saw posts at many different places. 

Just like the last post, I'm constructing a citable object here.
In this post, I will review the timeline of my experience. 
Then I try to collect some references showing how others are suffered.
This incident is a good (counter) "paraphrase" for Google's "DO NO EVIL". 

## My Case 

### Accident

   * Google released G+. Awesome. Gotta have a try!
   * Login my daily GMail, register for G+. 
   * Em, input some information. 
   Wow, they ask me for birthday?
   Why does it matter? 
   Anyway, just give something arbitrarily. 
   I don't want to write the real birthday on my profile.
   * I'm banned from G+:
   they say I'm under 13 years and can not use the service!
   * What's more, I can not login that GMail account!
   I was using that email address to handle all communications with my graduate department!
   That's July and I really have a lot of things to send and receive using that email account.

### Recovery

   * I try to follow their guide for account recovery.
   They need a scan of ID card and written proofs. 
   What's more, they ask to mail (not email) those materials to the head office in US!!
   * I did scan my ID, explain how the age was input incorrectly. 
   The last thing: mail to the US!
   First, it's costly. 
   Second, the post office in my town told me it's expected to arrive in one month. 
   One month!!
   * I remember they ask to fulfill the requirements in one month (or a bit more?). 
   Or else, they would permanently erase the account.
   (See [3] but the content is different from 2011; notably, they allow electronic uploading now)
   * I then recalled I have one friend in Google at that time. 
   I sent him the materials and asked him to forward the package for me.
   * The account was unblocked one day later. 

### Remarks

   * Age can not be used to determine whether or not to provide a service.
   * Even if you look at age, you shouldn't trust a field input from an HTML form.
   Don't you know most people will not give the real age? 
   * If you must do that, I think you should learn from those Chinese service providers. 
   They have API from the police database and everyone use their ID number and name to register. 
   You get real age in this way and you can use it to ban kids. 
   As a bonus, you even get their identities.
   * What? You don't want to force users to expose their identities?
   Then what the hell do you ask for the photocopy of my ID card??
   * OK, step back. 
   I am totally confortable not to use G+ 
   (Who want to use such a `!@#$!%^&` service?).
   Why do you block the whole account by the way?
   e.g. GMail, Calendar, etc.
   Those service are registered before the G+ accident! 
   * OK, you can do whatever you want. 
   Why don't you write the consequences explicitly on the page?
   There is not a sentence saying using G+ may risk at losing your account.
   If so, I would never give it an attempt.
   * OK, I understand you can change the term of service at any time
   without notification to the users. 
   I do what you want:
   give you the photocopy of my ID card and write proofs of my age.
   The problem is: why do you require a one-month period????
   Not everyone lives in the US!
   * I wasted one week's energy on this accident.
   * Later when I deal with Google or other service providers, 
   I would be extremely careful with the birthday field. 
   I usually input a random date in the 70's. 
   Why not ealier, e.g. 1900?
   Of course not, I'm afraid one day they come up with a new term:
   we do not provide services to dead (or almost dead) people. 
   This is really the kind of lesson that you remember it for a lifetime if you suffer once. 

## Others

You can find how other people are suffering from the referenced posts.

[4] is very funny to ask the question: how do children by pass the underage detection? 
Actually, it does not take any effort to "bypass". 
You randomly input a birth date and they don't have any way to validate it.
The real difficulty is on the contrary: 
how to prevent the adults from mis-input a small age.

[6] mentions the COPPA law which seems like an explanation for Google's act. 
It's actually a distraction here.
The major problem, as I put in the remark section, is not the adoption of any law.
The problem lies in the way they act:
discrepancies between services; lack of early notification; short grace period; etc.
