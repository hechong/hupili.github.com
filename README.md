# Eight Roads

This is Pili's personal blog with JekyllBootstrap backend. 

For all usage and documentation of JekyllBootstrap, 
please see: <http://jekyllbootstrap.com>

## ChangeLog and Reference. 

   * Ignore 'others' directory so that I can more conveniently do experiments with others Jekyll blogs:
   [Jekyll Ignore](http://blog.patrickcrosby.com/2009/09/05/jekyll-exclude-files.html)
   Also [Jekyll Issue](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/issues/77)
   (do not use wildcard). 
   * Adapt [yanping](https://github.com/yanping/art)'s 
   index template to show recent blog list. 
   * Note down
   [yanping](https://github.com/yanping/art). 
   May change comment system to Duoshuo later. 
   * Follow 
   [erjjones](https://github.com/erjjones/erjjones.github.com)'s
   note to setup the site and the feedback button.
