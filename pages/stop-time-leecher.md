STOP TIME LEECHER!!

Do you have papers? No? Then go back to your work!

It's not your fault to have a browser
but you really shouldn't visit that site at the moment. 

There is no perfect tool to fix the way people waste their time. 
You can stop the userscript at any moment. 
You can stop the plugin at any moment. 
You can change to another browser. 
You can change to another computer...
What this page can do is to help one form into a habit of 
not visiting those sites. 
You already suffered from visiting them at working time.
You don't want this to happen again in the future. 
You just don't have someone to watch your back. 

Remember, the tool and the page are mere kind reminders for you. 
When you see them, you know you are wasting your life.
