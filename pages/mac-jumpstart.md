   * Single point touch: 
   Move the pointer. 
   * Two points touch: 
   scroll up/down; scroll left/right; zoom in/out. 
   Try it out yourself with different apps. 
   * Three points touch: 
   left/right -- switch between multiple desktops;
   up == F3 -- multi-desktop view.
   * Four fingers scratch: Launchpad. 

## Must Install App

   "Go to directory" input box.
