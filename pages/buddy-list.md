## Criteria for Buddy List Enrollment 

Execute `AND` for the following statements:

   * You have updates in recent 6 months. 
   * You are qualified as tech geeks. 

Execute `OR` for the following statements to see whether you are qualified as tech geeks:

   * We know each other through other channels and I know you are technically strong.
   * You can point me to one tech post (on your blog) that is attractive enough.
   * You can point me to one Github repo (of you) that has more than 20 stars.
   * We have met during some tech activities, e.g. LUG, workshop, etc.
   * We work on the same direction and you can show me some related blog posts.

## Add/Update Your Entry

[This](https://github.com/hupili/hupili.github.com/blob/master/_includes/blog-links.md)
is the list file.

You can modify it by issuing a pull request to:
[https://github.com/hupili/hupili.github.com](https://github.com/hupili/hupili.github.com).

Feel free to leave your name, blog name, and introduction on the same list entry.
Although you are free in your own zone, I must regulate a bit to make the list uncluttered:

   * Normally, your blog homepage URL should be shorter than 50 characters. 
   * The description part (except URL) can be either English or Chinese.
   * The description part should be shorter than 50 chars for Chinese OR 150 chars for English. 
   * You can embed your favicon via an image link in markdown notation. 
   This icon does not count for description length.
   * Don't use HTML tags.
   * `append()` yourself to the list. Don't be queue jumpers.

Ur? You don't know how to do this?
Are you kidding...
You may want to go back to the above section to see if you are qualified...
