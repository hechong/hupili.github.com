After being a tutor for two years, I feel it time consuming to grade the homeworks.
Besides the large volume of classes, the homework convetion is also an important factor.
The freestyle submissions do increase us some unnecessary workload. 
Apart from this, some bad practices will also unintentionally lower the grade.
For example, someone disorders the questions and the tutor misses some answers.
For another example, someone submit `docx` format 
and the figures does not render correctly in some environment.

For the benefits of both sides.
I think compiling and explaining the good practices of homeworks is essential.
We can not force everyone to abide by those good practices.
As a tutor, we will try best to interpret the submission no matter how ill formatted it is.
However, some cases are so bad that even with our best effort 
some grades are lost unintentionally due to bad formatting. 

## To Do 

Normal suggestion:

   * Use `pdf` for report. 
   * Write report in a single file. 
   * Avoid compression at most time.
   * Type an electronic report and print out. 

If you must write: 

  * Use your best hand writings.

If you do the homework with hand writing and want to submit softcopy:

   * Take photos; 
   rotate to correct angle; 
   put all the photos into one single PDF file, one picture per page. 
   * Avoid perpendicularly oriented photos.
   * Check whether you can read the answer easily before submission:
   proper lighting condition; enough resolution; etc. 
   * Had better not submit an archive of mutiple photo files. 

If you must compress:

   * Use `zip`, `gzip`, `tar.gz` for compression if needed. 
   * If the above is not available,
   try best to use some popular compression scheme,
   e.g. `7z`, `bzip`, `rar`, etc.
   By "popular", we mean **at least** some open source uncompress program is readily available
   (e.g. although `rar` is proprietary format, `unrar` is available in most distributions). 
   * Negative example: "kuaizip".
   It uses the same suffix as `zip` but requires its own software to uncompress.

## Not To Do

   * **Disorder the questions**.
   This is the most common bad habit.
   Among 40 hardcopies I received recently, 
   at least 10 submissions disorder the questions to some extent.
   The most serious ones look like this:
   "Q4 (a) (1) point 1 ... point 2 ... Q1 (e) ... point 3 (of Q4 (a) (1))".
   As said at the beginning, it on one hand drastically increase our searching time
   and on the other hand may lower your grade if we miss any of them.
   * **Use different numbering scheme that the question statement.**
   e.g. We use "(1)" for the 1st subproblem but you uses "(a)" for it. 
   Although it does not matter very much, we strong suggest not to do it. 
   It increases our searching time, especially when there are multiple levels of numbering
   like "Q2. (a) (1)". 
   * **Stuff the whole page.** 
   We should have some space to put down the grades.
   Usually, an answer paper with parallel bars will leave you some 
   margin on the left, right, top, and bottom. 
   If you use a blank paper, do not write a full row. 
   * **Use red ink.**
   When I was in primary school, the teacher said that using red ink is an offense to her. 
   I don't think it so serious but red ink will mix our grading.
   It should be avoided.
   * **Use a paper with very complex background.**
   Someone submit answer sheet with very complex and colorful background. 
   We can hardly read the answer then. 
   * **Submit both hardcopy and softcopy.**
   If there is any discrepancy in the grading, the lower one will be used.
   If you only want to secure the submission, please put down a note, 
   e.g. "I submitted both softcopy and hardcopy".
   It's appreciated because we don't waste time grading the same thing again.
