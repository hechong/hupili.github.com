Different from Blog posts, articles are more seriously written. 
They are constantly evolving. 
In some sense, a portion of them are also my notes on a particular topic. 
I will frequently revisit them to compensate my poor memory. 

<h2>List of Articles</h2>

<ul class="nav">
  {% assign pages_list = site.pages %}
  {% assign group = 'article' %}
  {% include JB/pages_list %}
</ul>
